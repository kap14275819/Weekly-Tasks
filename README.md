## Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple
#### In maths the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is the largest positive integer that divides into two or more intergers which are not all 0.
#### In maths the Least Common Multiple (LCM) is The least common multiple to appear in a list of multiplications of two or more intergers which are not all 0.

## Examples

#### What is the GCD of 22 and 32 ?
#### The divisors of 22 are 1, 2, 11, 12.
#### The divisors of 32 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
#### Both have 1 and 2 in their lists. This means that 2 is the GCD.
#### What is the LCM of 6 and 10 ?
#### The Multiplications of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, ... And so on.
#### The Mulitplications of 10 are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ... And so on.
#### The LCM in these lists is 30, therefore the LCM of 6 and 10 is 30.
